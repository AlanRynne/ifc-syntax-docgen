# IFC Syntax DocGen

> :warning: This repo has been deprecated in favour of the new monorepo I created with all my IFC related code. You can check it out at:

> [IFC Developer Tools](https://github.com/AlanRynne/ifc-developer-tools)
> 
> It includes:
> - `ifc` and `express` parsers
> - The IFC Syntax VSCode Extension code
> - The IFC Language Server
> - An IFC to Typescript code generator
> - An IFC documentation extraction tool
> 
> See you there!!

Documentation information extractor tool for IFC releases. It extracts the information from the published HTML docs at https://technical.buildingsmart.org/standards/ifc/ifc-schema-specifications/

> Currently only tested in version 4x2.

If you just want to grab the generated JSON files, head to the Releases section.
